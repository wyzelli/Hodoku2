# Hodoku2
An updated version of HoDoKu in a new repo

This takes the original code from https://hodoku.sourceforge.net/en/index.php, and merges it with the updates by Pseudofish from https://github.com/PseudoFish/Hodoku.

Then this whole set has been updated to work with JRE 18.

There is an exe and a built jar in the dist folder.
